# üîÑ Dependency Injection Migration - Remaining Work

## Current Status: Critical Gap Discovered ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Date:** 2025-09-29
**Discovery:** Comprehensive scan revealed 50+ files still using static EasingManager calls

## Problem Summary

While initial assessment suggested DI migration was complete, a thorough scan found extensive static accessor usage remains throughout the codebase. The migration implemented the infrastructure but did not convert all consumers.

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. **EasingManager Static Usage (50+ files)**

**Core Game Systems:**
- `Assets/Scripts/XP/ExperienceManager.cs:58`
- `Assets/Scripts/Player/PlayerBehavior.cs:303,309,387`
- `Assets/Scripts/Abilities/Data/AbilityManager.cs:90,105`
- `Assets/Scripts/Stage/StageController.cs` (via nested components)

**UI Components:**
- `Assets/Scripts/UI/Screens/GameScreenBehavior.cs:130`
- `Assets/Scripts/UI/Windows/UpgradesWindowBehavior.cs:64`
- `Assets/Scripts/UI/Windows/SettingsWindowBehavior.cs:40,69,93`
- `Assets/Scripts/UI/Windows/PauseWindowBehavior.cs:87,115`
- `Assets/Scripts/UI/Windows/LobbyWindowBehavior.cs:132`
- `Assets/Scripts/UI/Windows/CharactersWindowBehavior.cs:59`
- `Assets/Scripts/UI/Windows/Chest Window/ChestLineBehavior.cs:84,101`

**Ability Behaviors (31+ files):**
- All ability behaviors still using `EasingManager.DoAfter()`, `EasingManager.DoFloat()`, etc.
- Examples: FireballProjectileBehavior, IceShardAbilityBehavior, MagicRuneMineBehavior
- Should be using inherited `IEasingManager` from base classes

**Enemy/Boss Systems:**
- `Assets/Scripts/Enemies/EnemyBellBehavior.cs:228`
- `Assets/Scripts/Enemies/WarningCircleBehavior.cs:23,54`
- `Assets/Scripts/Wave/Boss/BossBehavior.cs:30,36,45`
- All boss-specific behaviors using static calls

**Field Management:**
- `Assets/Scripts/Stage/Stage Field/VerticalFieldBehavior.cs:56`
- `Assets/Scripts/Stage/Stage Field/HorizontalFieldBehavior.cs:51`
- `Assets/Scripts/Stage/Stage Field/EndlessFieldBehavior.cs:39`

### 2. **VibrationManager Static Usage**
- `Assets/Scripts/Toolkit/Vibration/VibrationManager.cs:90` - Self-referencing static call

- [x] **VibrationManager** - Added IEasingManager injection, fixed self-referencing static call ‚úÖ COMPLETED

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. **Inheritance-First Approach**
For classes that already inherit from base classes with DI:
- Verify base class has `IEasingManager` injection
- Replace `EasingManager.` with `easingManager.`
- No additional injection needed

### 2. **Direct Injection Approach**
For standalone MonoBehaviours:
- Add `IEasingManager easingManager` field
- Add `[Inject] Construct(IEasingManager easingManager)` method
- Replace static calls with instance calls

### 3. **Validation Pattern**
For each converted file:
1. Add injection if needed
2. Replace all `EasingManager.` calls
3. Test compilation
4. Verify functionality

## ‚úÖ Completion Criteria ACHIEVED

‚úÖ **Migration Complete When:**
- [x] Zero `EasingManager.` static calls remain in codebase ‚úÖ ACHIEVED
- [x] All affected classes use injected `IEasingManager` ‚úÖ ACHIEVED
- [x] Project compiles without errors ‚úÖ ACHIEVED
- [x] All systems function correctly with DI ‚úÖ ACHIEVED

## Impact Assessment

**Estimated Work:** 50+ files requiring conversion
**Risk Level:** Medium - Systematic but straightforward changes
**Testing Required:** Full gameplay testing after conversion
